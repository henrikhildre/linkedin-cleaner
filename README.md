# LinkedIn Cleaner

A Chrome extension that helps you maintain a cleaner, more focused LinkedIn feed by automatically hiding distracting content.
Please note: all code here is AI generated (including this README (but paradoxically not this line of text))

## Features

- ðŸš« **Long Document Blocking**: Automatically hides posts with more than 3 pages/slides
- ðŸ˜Š **Emoji Control**: Blocks posts that use excessive emoji bullet points
- ðŸ‘€ **Show Anyway**: Each hidden post can be revealed with a single click
- ðŸŽ¨ **Native Design**: Seamlessly integrates with LinkedIn's interface
- ðŸ”’ **Privacy First**: Works entirely locally - no data collection or external services

## How It Works

The extension monitors your LinkedIn feed and automatically hides:
1. Documents/slideshows with more than 3 pages
2. Posts that use 2 or more different emoji bullet points

When content is hidden, you'll see:
- A clean placeholder showing why the post was hidden
- The author's name
- A "Show Anyway" button to reveal the content if desired
